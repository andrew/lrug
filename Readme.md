# LRUG

A Rubymotion App created to demo at London Ruby User Group November 2012 meetup.

## Development

Source hosted at [GitHub](http://github.com/andrew/lrug).
Report Issues/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues](http://github.com/andrew/lrug/issues).

Tests can be ran with `rake spec`

### Note on Patches/Pull Requests

 * Fork the project.
 * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
 * Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
   future version unintentionally.
 * Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
   (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
 * Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
